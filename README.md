# Social Network Analysis


This project is a simple C-based simulation of a social network. It creates user profiles, allows users to form connections, and stores data in a file. This simulation can help understand basic data structures like graphs, user profile management, and file handling in C.

 ## Features :
* User Profiles: Create profiles with attributes such as ID, name, and bio.
* Connections: Establish connections between users, represented as edges in a graph.
* Data Persistence: Save user profiles and connections in a file for persistence.
## Project Structure :
* User Profile Management: Each user has a profile, stored with an ID, name, and bio.
* Graph Structure: Connections between users are represented using an adjacency matrix.
* File Handling: User profiles and connections are saved to social_network_data.txt.
## Files :
* Mini_project.c: Main program implementing the social network simulation.
* social_network_data.txt: File where user profiles and connections are stored.
